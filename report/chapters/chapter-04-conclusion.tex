\section{Conclusion}
This study evalueted the Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) from Kubernetes on two different scenarios: Minikube and Amazon EKS. While both environments effectively manage dynamic workloads, Minikube is better suited for local development due to its limited scalability, since it is limited to the machine resources, whereas EKS excels in production scenarios that demand high performance and reliability.

The choice between these platforms should align with the specific needs of the application. Minikube is ideal for rapid testing, development and learning, while EKS is preferable for applications requiring robust, scalable, and consistent performance in production.

Future work could explore optimizing HPA configurations for different workloads, as well as investigating other Kubernetes environments and scaling strategies to further refine the decision-making process for deployment environments.
