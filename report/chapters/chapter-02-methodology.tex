\section{Methodology}

The methodology section describes the tools, technologies, and procedures employed in conducting the experiments.
The evaluation is divided into two parts: the first part involves experimentation on a local computer using Minikube as main tool, while the second part focuses on experimentation within a cloud environment using AWS EKS.

\subsection{Minikube procedure}
% Some introduction
The following methodology is based on the tutorial \textit{Horizontal Pod Autoscaler Walkthrough}~\cite{KubernetesHpaWalkthrough}, which consists in setting up a deployment on a local computer using Minikube; then, the HPA is configured to scale the deployment based on CPU usage; an external script is used to simulate a load on the deployment; finally, the script is stopped.
This subsection describes the steps to reproduce the experiment.

% Step 1: Configuring Kubernetes cluster configuration



% Procedure

% Description of the computer and software versions
The computer used for the local experimentations runs a \operatingSystem{} in an \cpuModel{} processor with \cpuCores{} cores and \cpuRam{}~GB of RAM.
The version of \texttt{minikube} is \minikubeVersion{}, \texttt{kubectl} client is \kubectlClientVersion{}, \texttt{kubectl} server is \kubectlServerVersion{}, and \texttt{kustomize} is \kubectlKustomizeVersion{}.
